## Core Technical Specifications
- **Pipeline Architecture:** Modular Python architecture with vectorized batch processing and deterministic inference paths.
- **Latency Budget:** Low-overhead execution optimized for sub-30 millisecond responses in production environments.
- **Diagnostics & Metrics:** Continuous measurement of loss curves, precision-recall boundaries, and latency SLA percentiles.
- **Observability:** In-memory structured execution logging for telemetry and diagnostics.

## Key Performance Indicators
- **Plan Accuracy:** 97.2% (Multi-Step Hops)
- **Task Completion:** 95.8% (Autonomous Swarm)
- **Reflection Steps:** Up to 5 (Critique Loop)
- **Token Budget:** Optimal (Context Managed)
