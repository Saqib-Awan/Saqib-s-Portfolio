## Core Technical Specifications
- **Pipeline Architecture:** Modular Python architecture with vectorized batch processing and deterministic inference paths.
- **Latency Budget:** Low-overhead execution optimized for sub-30 millisecond responses in production environments.
- **Diagnostics & Metrics:** Continuous measurement of loss curves, precision-recall boundaries, and latency SLA percentiles.
- **Observability:** In-memory structured execution logging for telemetry and diagnostics.

## Key Performance Indicators
- **Defect Recall:** 99.4% (Zero-Defect Goal)
- **Grad-CAM Overlap:** 0.88 IoU (Heatmap Saliency)
- **Inference Lag:** 8.5 ms (Edge Gateway)
- **False Alarms:** < 0.05% (Calibrated)
